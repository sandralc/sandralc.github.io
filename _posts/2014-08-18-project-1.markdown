overview: Bittrip is a single player, third-person platform adventure in 2.5D (3D with a 2D view) where a single bit called Bit (what a surprise!) has to travel through optical fiber, servers and wifi, dealing with evil bosses such as the big horse Troian, to deliver 1 bit of information. Bit can exist in two different modes - "one" and "zero" - each of which activates and deactivates Bit's abilities and its environment.

description: In this project the whole team had to deal and go through all stages of game development, from Pre-production to the Gold Master release. <br>I was primarily responsible for the game concept design, the design of characters (artistically) and their story, the design of the levels, their elements and the challenges and actions the player had to overcome to go through the game. <br>I was also responsible for the modelling of the 3D scenario elements, textures, lights and texture animations of the game for every level.<br><br>Other duties included programming and designing the GUI elements of each screen and some of the functionalities and behaviours of items in the scenario.
